The LinearSplit module implements partitioning the sequence of items to the 
subsequences in the order given. The next functions are provided:
   gPartition  - split the sequence of items items using greedy heuristic. 
   lPartition  - split the sequence of items to minimize the maximum cost 
                 over all the subsequences using linear partition algorithm
                 (see the 'The Algorithm Design Manual' by Steven S. Skiena..)  
   ltPartition - the approximation of the linear partition algorithm.
                 The large size of the work items space is decreased by
                 combining the consecutive items based on the threshold 
                 parameter.
See examples/Splitter.hs for the usage help.

For example, the next command will split the items in test1.txt on 5 ranges using
greedy heuristics and linear partition algorithm.
$ Splitter -f test1.txt -n -o -g -t500 -s5
